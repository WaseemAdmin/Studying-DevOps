###Linux Storage Layout

Black Storage Layout

The standard linux file systems organize storage on hard disk drives. Disks are usually accessed in physical blocks, rather than a byte (8 bits) at a time. Block sizes may range from 512 bytes to 4K or larger.
A file is represented by an inode, a kind of a serial number containing information about the actual data that makes up the file: to whom this file belongs, and where is it located on the hard disk.

In Linux, files are stored on disk using **inodes** and **data blocks**.
The filename itself does **not** contain the file data — it only points to an inode.

### Example Commands

```bash
ls -i file1
Output:
2372244 file1

The number 2372244 is the inode number of file1.

stat file1
File: file1
Size: 13            Blocks: 8       IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: fd01h/64769d  Inode: 2372244   Links: 1
Access: (0664/-rw-rw-r--)  Uid: (1000/myuser)  Gid: (1000/myuser)
